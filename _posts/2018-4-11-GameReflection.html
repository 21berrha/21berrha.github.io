<h2>One Challange I encountered, and how I Overcame it</h2>
<p>The main challange I encountered was how to make your background an image. I figured this out by going back to the directions, and there was a link that took me to a code that showed how to put an image as a background.</p>
 
<h2>One Element of my game that I am proud of, and why</h2>
<p> I am really proud of all of the many pages in my game. It was a lot of work, and I did a lot of it on my own time. I have at least 20 pages inside of the game. Thats a lot!</p>

<h2>One idea for how I can Extend my game in the future</h2>
<p>I want to fisrt of all, finnish year one, and then extend it all the way to year 7.</p>
